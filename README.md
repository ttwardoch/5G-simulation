This code is a modified example from Mathworks. I added Doppler spectrum channel and estimation into the system to test if it works as a part of the whole system with tap delay line.

DLSCHAndPDSCHTransmitAndReceiveProcessingChainExample.mlx contains a live editor
Copy_DLSCHAndPDSCHTransmitAndReceiveProcessingChainExample.mlx contains only code with loops to create BER vs SNR graphs.
